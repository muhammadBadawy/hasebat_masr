                Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives.
                Many companies have created a position of chief information officer (CIO) that sits on the executive board
                with the chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO),
                and chief technical officer (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The chief information
                security officer (CISO) focuses on information security management.
                The six components that must come together in order to produce an information system are:
                Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred
                to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipments. Among the support equipments are input and
                output devices, storage devices and communications devices.
                Software: The term software the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware"
                is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedure.

                A computer(-based) information system is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:
                As the name suggest, each FAIS support a particular function within the organization,
                e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production/operation management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS.
                In finance and accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business activity,
               to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform audits to ensure that the organization is
               fundamentally sound and that all financial reports and documents are accurate. Other types of organizational
               information systems are FAIS, Transaction processing systems, enterprise resource planning, office automation system,
               management information system, decision support system, expert system, executive dashboard, supply chain management system,
               and electronic commerce system.
                Dashboards are a special form of IS that support all managers of the organization.

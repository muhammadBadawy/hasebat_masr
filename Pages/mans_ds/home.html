                <h2>The concept of decision support has evolved from two main areas of research: The theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the technical work on Technology in the 1960s.[4] DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, executive information systems (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.</h2>

                <h2>As mentioned above, there are theoretical possibilities of building such systems in any knowledge domain.

One is the clinical decision support system for medical diagnosis. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS). The primitive version is standalone which does not support integration. The second generation of CDSS supports integration with other medical systems. The third generation is standard-based while the fourth is service model-based.[18]

Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.

A passive DSS is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An active DSS can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A cooperative DSS allows the decision maker (or its advisor) to modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation. The system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.

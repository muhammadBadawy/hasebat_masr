                <h2 class="t2">System software :</h2>
                    <p class="t3">is the software used to manage and control the hardware components and which allow interaction between the hardware and the other types of software. the most obvious type of system software is the computer's operating system but device drivers are also included within this category.</p>
                <h2 class="t2">Utility software :</h2>
                    <p class="t3">is software such as anti-virus software, firewalls, disk defragmenters and so on which helps to maintain and protect the computer system but does not directly interface with the hardware.</p>
                <h2 class="t2">Applications software :</h2>
                    <p class="t3">(also known as "apps") are designed to allow the user of the system complete a specific task or set of tasks. they include programs such as web browsers, office software, games and so on. they are usually the reason you bought the computer system in the first place and aren't concerned with the management or maintenance of the system itself.</p>

            <h1 class="e1">Different Types Of Software Engineering</h1>
                <h2 class="e2">Online Software Engineering Degrees :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">there are many online options for software engineering today. pennsylvania state university has one of the best online programs available. the program, like many others, is 100 percent online. online programs cover the same core material without being restricted to a formal classroom setting.</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Software Design &amp; Development :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">many people say the best products and software starts with the best planning. the definition and design of the architecture, components, user interfaces, and other components for software is an extremely important part of any software development project. likewise, after the scope is created by the software design architect, the development engineer (or team of development engineers) build the software through coding, unit, integration, and regression testing, and debugging.</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Software Quality Assurance &amp; Testing :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">quality assurance (qa) is an integral part to any software. qa analysts test in multiple environments to find specific instances and provide provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product.</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Software Engineering Configuration Management Degrees :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">it is important to have configuration specialists to configure the software over time and maintain the integrity of how the software was built and intended for use. the maintenance of software can sometimes get lost in the shuffle of a busy business, but it is important to ensure updates and maintenance so the software does not become deprecated and allow for security vulnerabilities.</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Web, Game, &amp; Mobile Application Development Engineering Degrees :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">game, web, and mobile application development is a popular sub category for software engineer programs. such programs focus on expanding graphic features and user interface for the gaming community. advanced software architecture in smartphones and computer browsers are studied in mobile applications</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Information Security Engineering Degrees :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">information security is a specialty that confronts a corporation’s databases systems to prevent large scale identity theft. digital image processing is another elective track pursed by software engineers. these courses introduce voice and facial recognition software. image restoration, color enhancement, geometric processes are all explored within this category.</p>
                <h2 class="e2">Artificial Intelligence Engineering Degrees :</h2>
                    <p class="e3">artificial intelligence (ai), particularly law enforcement artificial intelligence is another concentration that is in high demand. large businesses, the military and other government entities such as nasa, often use complex software design. artificial intelligence can be used in situations to dangerous or impractical for humans.</p>

            <h1 class="w1">Different Types Of Web Design Languages</h1>
                <h2 class="w2">HTML Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">html (hypertext markup language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a world wide web browser page. the markup tells the web browser how to display a web page's words and images for the user. each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag). some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>
                    <p class="w4">html is a formal recommendation by the world wide web consortium (w3c) and is generally adhered to by the major browsers,  microsoft's internet explorer and netscape's navigator, which also provide some additional non-standard codes. the current version of html is html 4.0. however, both internet explorer and netscape implement some features differently and provide non-standard extensions. web developers using the more advanced features of html 4 may have to design pages for both browsers and send out the appropriate version to a user. significant features in html 4 are sometimes described in general as dynamic html. what is sometimes referred to as html 5 is an extensible form of html called extensible hypertext markup language (xhtml).</p>
                <h2 class="w2">HTML5 Language :</h1>
                    <p class="w3">is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the world wide web. it is the fifth and current version of the html standard.</p>
                    <p class="w4">it was published in october 2014 by the world wide web consortium (w3c) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. html5 is intended to subsume not only html 4, but also xhtml 1 and dom level 2 html.</p>
                    <p class="w5">html5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (apis) for complex web applications. for the same reasons, html5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
                <h2 class="w2">CSS Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">cascading style sheets (css) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. these documents are written in a markup language such as html.</p>
                    <p class="w4">a document is a collection of information that is structured using a markup language.</p>
                    <p class="w5">presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. browsers, like firefox, chrome or internet explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>
                <h2 class="w2">CSS3 Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">css3 is the latest version of the css specification. the term “css3” is not just a reference to the new features in css, but the third level in the progress of the css specification. css3 contains just about everything that’s included in css2.1 (the previous version of the specification). it also adds new features to help developers solve a number of problems without the need for non-semantic markup, complex scripting, or extra images.</p>
                <h2 class="w2">JAVASCRIPT Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. it has been standardized in the ecmascript language specification. alongside html and css, it is one of the three core technologies of world wide web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. javascript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. it has an api for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any i/o, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
                <h2 class="w2">JQUERY Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">is a cross-platform javascript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of html. jquery is the most popular javascript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the web. jquery is free, open-source software licensed under the mit license.</p>
                    <p class="w4">jquery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select dom elements, create animations, handle events, and develop ajax applications. jquery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the javascript library. this enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. the modular approach to the jquery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
                <h2 class="w2">PHP Language :</h2>
                    <p class="w3">is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. originally created by rasmus lerdorf in 1994, the php reference implementation is now produced by the php group. php originally stood for personal home page, but it now stands for the recursive backronym php: hypertext preprocessor.</p>
                    <p class="w4">php code may be embedded into html code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management system and web frameworks. php code is usually processed by a php interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a common gateway interface (cgi) executable. the web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed php code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. php code may also be executed with a command-line interface (cli) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.</p>

            <h1 class="p1">Different Types Of Programming Languages</h1>
                <h2 class="p2">C Language :</h2>
                    <p class="p3">is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. by design, c provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
                    <p class="p4">c was originally developed by dennis ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at bell labs, and used to re-implement the unix operating system. it has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with c compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. c has been standardized by the american national standards institute (ansi) since 1989 (see ansi c) and subsequently by the international organization for standardization (iso).</p>
                <h2 class="p2">C++ Language :</h2>
                    <p class="p3">is a general-purpose programming language. it has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation</p>
                    <p class="p4">it was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. c++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or sql servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). c++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the fsf, llvm, microsoft, intel and ibm.</p>
                    <p class="p5">c++ is standardized by the international organization for standardization (iso), with the latest standard version ratified and published by iso in december 2014 as iso/iec 14882:2014 (informally known as c++14). the c++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as iso/iec 14882:1998, which was then amended by the c++03, iso/iec 14882:2003, standard. the current c++14 standard supersedes these and c++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. before the initial standardization in 1998, c++ was developed by bjarne stroustrup at bell labs since 1979, as an extension of the c language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to c, which also provided high-level features for program organization.</p>
                <h2 class="p2">C# Language :</h2>
                    <p class="p3">is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. it was developed by microsoft within its .net initiative and later approved as a standard by ecma (ecma-334) and iso (iso/iec 23270:2006). c# is one of the programming languages designed for the common language infrastructure.</p>
                    <p class="p4">c# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. its development team is led by anders hejlsberg. the most recent version is c# 6.0, which was released on july 20, 2015.</p>
                <h2 class="p2">JAVA Language :</h2>
                    <p class="p3">is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. it is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (wora), meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without the need for recompilation. java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any java virtual machine (jvm) regardless of computer architecture. as of 2016, java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] java was originally developed by james gosling at sun microsystems (which has since been acquired by oracle corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of sun microsystems' java platform. the language derives much of its syntax from c and c++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
                    <p class="p4">The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>
                    <p class="p5">the latest version is java 8, which is the only version currently supported for free by oracle, although earlier versions are supported both by oracle and other companies on a commercial basis.</p>
                <h2 class="p2">PYTHON Language :</h2>
                    <p class="p3">is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as c++ or java. the language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
                    <p class="p4">python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. it features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
                    <p class="p5">python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing python code to run on a wide variety of systems. using third-party tools, such as py2exe or pyinstaller, python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, so python-based software can be distributed to, and used on, those environments with no need to install a python interpreter.</p>
                    <p class="p6">cpython, the reference implementation of python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. cpython is managed by the non-profit python software foundation.</p>
